## Overview

The repository includes two main classes for generating points:
- `RandomPointsGenerator`: Generates random points in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates.
- `CosmologicalPointsGenerator`: Generates random points with cosmological distances (comoving, proper, luminosity).

Points are generated and saved as JSON files, suitable for further analysis in astrophysical simulations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astrophysics-points-generator.git
   cd astrophysics-points-generator
